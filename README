This project contains 
1. TI-RTOS/CCS based firmware of a CC1310 micro-controller. The firmware includes the implementation of a transmitter and a receiver on cc1310. The firmware is used to measure the wake time of the radio & total transmission time of packets at different transmission power and modulations (GFSK & OOK).

2. Different plots that were generated from the data collected by varying the parameters mentioned in 1.

3. A draft of journal paper to be submitted to mdpi

To be added
1.Matlab scripts that were used for the plots 
2. raw measurement data
